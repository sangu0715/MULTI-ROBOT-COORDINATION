## Abstract
This project investigates gradient-based navigation and cyclic pursuit strategies for achieving synchronized multi-robot motion using TurtleBot3 and ROS2. The system includes:
- SLAM for real-time mapping
- Navigation stack integration
- Collision avoidance
- Decentralized coordination

The full thesis PDF is included as `GROUP9_Panel1.pdf`.

## Tools and Technologies
- ROS 2 (Humble)
- Gazebo & RViz
- TurtleBot3 (Burger)
- MATLAB (for simulation)
- SLAM Toolbox
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

## Simulation and Hardware Highlights
- Gradient-based coordination simulation in MATLAB
- SLAM-based map creation and saving
- Multi-robot coordination using namespaces in ROS2
- Real-world hardware implementation on TurtleBot3
